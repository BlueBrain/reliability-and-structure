In this directory we provide all the scripts use to compute the different network metrics.  The directory is structured as follows: 

- **structural:** Subdirectory to analyze purely structural properties for all connectomes and their corresponding controls.
    - **code:** Scripts that generate the data
    - **visualization_and_notebooks:** Scripts or notebooks to visualize data or generate figures 
- **activity:** Subdirectory to analyze properties that relate to function or link function to structure in BBP and MICrONS
    - **computation:** Scripts that generate the data
    - **visualization:** Scripts or notebooks to visualize data or generate figures 
 
# TODO:
