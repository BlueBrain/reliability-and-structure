It is recommended to create a new virtual environment within which to run the pipeline, by doing:

```
python -m venv topsamp
source ./topsamp/bin/activate
```

To install run:
```
sh install.sh
```

Then run with:
```
python run.py
```

# TODO:
- [ ] community_database.pkl is already in the zenodo.  Can this code be structured as the user gives a path to the zenodo files to run this?
- [ ] Add quick description of create_results_df.py
- [ ] Add quick description of run.py
